# DS-ALGO

today i learned about the data types in c++
there are various data types like int float char double
so int take 4 bytes of memory space
flot take 4 bytes char takes 1 byte and bool takes 1 byte
1 byte = 8 bits
therefore 8 bytes = 8X8 = 64 bits
the range of unsigned integer is 0 to 2^32-1 
the range of signed intger is -2^32 to 2^32-1
